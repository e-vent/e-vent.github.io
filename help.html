<h3 class="q">How does E-vent earn money?</h3>
<p class="ans">We have ads. We also have Premium E-vent for business and organizations.</p>
<h3 class="q">Why is Javascript required in order to use E-vent?</h3>
<p class="ans">E-vent isn't just a website. It's a webAPP! Like Google Docs, Discord, Discourse, and other webapps, E-vent is an app runs in your browser. To make a webpage come to life and not simply be a text file, Javascript is needed to connect to the cloud, listen for new events, and submit events to the cloud, in addition to displaying all of that. Disabling Javascript is like taking a screenshot of an app and trying to interact with the screenshot. It's not fun when Javascript is disabled.</p>
<h3 class="q">What are the system requirements for E-vent (web)?</h3>
<p class="ans">You're probably already all set. Just keep using that browser and stay connected to the internet. We recommend the latest Google Chrome. Other browsers may work, but you're on your own.</p>
<h3 class="q">What are the system requirements for E-vent (Android)?</h3>
<p class="ans">The Android version also needs internet. The minimum is Android 5.0 (Lollipop). Don't spend time trying to figure out your system version, just download the app and install it. It is smart and won't install is your system if out of date.</p>
<h3 class="q">How do I advertise with E-vent?</h3>
<p class="ans">We'd love to advertise together! Just send us an email at advertising@e-vent.github.io</p>
